# README

This code contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model implemented using PyTorch, and a training function to train the model on MNIST dataset. The model architecture consists of two convolutional layers with ReLU activation, each followed by a max pooling layer, followed by two fully connected layers with ReLU activation, and a dropout layer for regularization. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer.
